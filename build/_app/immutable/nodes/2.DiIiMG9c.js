The estimates are developed from a base that incorporates decennial census data, estimates data, and Demographic Analysis estimates data (where applicable). // 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the decennial census are modified to be consistent with the race categories which appear in estimates input data. This contributes to differences between the population for specific race categories shown in this file versus those published from the decennial census. Current data on births, deaths, and migration are used to calculate population change since the previous decennial census. An annual time series of estimates is produced, beginning at the date of the previous census and extending to the vintage year. The vintage year refers to the final year of the time series. The reference date for all estimates is July 1, unless otherwise specified. With each new vintage of estimates, the entire estimates series is revised.

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",contact:"acso.users.support@census.gov"},{title:"American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Comparison Profiles 1-Year",name:"acs/acs1/cprofile",vintage:"2021",type:"Aggregate",temporal:"2021/2021",spatial:"US",url:"http://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs1/cprofile",modified:"2022-04-29 00:00:00.0",description:"The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services.

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.",contact:"acso.users.support@census.gov"},{title:"2011 County Business Patterns - Zip Code Business Patterns: Total For Zip Code",name:"zbp",vintage:"2011",type:"Aggregate",temporal:"2011/2011",spatial:"United States",url:"http://api.census.gov/data/2011/zbp",modified:"2018-01-25",description:"ZIP Code Business Patterns (ZBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by ZIP Code.

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

They differ from the postcensal estimates that are released annually because they rely on a formula that redistributes the difference between the April 1 postcensal estimate and April 1 census count for the end of the decade across the estimates for that decade. Meanwhile, the postcensal estimates incorporate current data on births, deaths, and migration to produce each new vintage of estimates, and to revise estimates for years back to the last census.
